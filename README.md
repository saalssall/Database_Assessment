## ⚠️ Intentional Constraint Violations (Task 2 Part D & E)

These inserts are **designed to fail** to demonstrate enforcement of database constraints:

| Insert | Constraint Violated |
|---|---|
| Patient with `NULL` ID | `NOT NULL` on primary key |
| Doctor with duplicate email | `UNIQUE` on `email` |
| Room with availability `'T'` | `ENUM ('Y', 'N')` |
| Treatment with `Total_Cost = 0.4` | `CHECK (Total_Cost > 0)` (rounds to 0) |
| Medication referencing treatment `40` | Foreign key — treatment does not exist |
| Treatment with `room_number = 9` | Foreign key — room does not exist |

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Open **MySQL Workbench** (or any MySQL client).
2. Run the full script top to bottom.
3. Tasks 2–6 each create and switch to their own database — no manual setup needed.

> **Note:** `Assessment_3B_24s2_HomebaseDB` must already exist and be populated before running Tasks 3 and 4.
